I'm a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My research interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra and effective algebraic geometry to differential algebra and dynamical systems.

On this webpage you can find my research statement, published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, information on talks, conferences, research visits, teaching, and a short CV.
