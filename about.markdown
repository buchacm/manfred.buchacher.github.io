I am a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My research interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra, differential algebra, effective algebraic geometry to dynamical systems.

On this webpage you can find a research statement, published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, information on teaching, talks, conferences, research visits, and a short CV.
