I am a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My research interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra, effective algebraic geometry, dynamical systems to differential algebra.

On this webpage you can find my published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, a research statement, information on teaching, talks, conferences, research visits, and a short CV.
