- x(1-t(x+x^{-1}) F(x;t) = x - tF(0;t). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21753" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

This paper is an introduction to the enumeration of restricted lattice walks that can also be seen as an introduction to my research.

These articles are dedicated to the problem of finding polynomials / rational functions with separated variables. The first explains how to determine $I \cap \left(\mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right)$ for an ideal $I$ in a bivariate polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ that is given in terms of a bases. The second and third continue the ideas developed therein and study equations of the form $r(x,y) + q(x,y) p(x,y) = f(x) - g(y)$ for rational functions $r$, $q$, $p$ and $f$ and $g$ of which only the rational function $r$ and the polynnomial $p$ is known.
