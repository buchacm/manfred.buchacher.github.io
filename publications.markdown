- x(1-t(x+x^{-1}) F(x;t) = x - tF(0;t). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21753" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

This paper is an introduction to the enumeration of restricted lattice walks that can also be seen as an introduction to my research.

- Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01541" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

- Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10377" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

- Separated variables on plane algebraic curves. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08584" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These articles discuss problems of finding polynomials / rational functions whose variables are separated. The first explains how to determine $I \cap \left(\mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right)$ when $I$ is an ideal in a bivariate polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ given in terms of a bases. The second and third continue the ideas developed therein to study equations of the form $r(x,y) + q(x,y) p(x,y) = f(x) - g(y)$ for rational functions $r$, $q$, $p$ and $f$ and $g$ of which only the rational function $r$ and the polynnomial $p$ is known. The latter has a field theoretic interpretation. It relates to (the simplest instance of) the problem of computing intersections of fields and finding certain decompositions of elements thereof. The arguments involve linear algebra, the Newton-Puiseux algorithm and Galois theory.          

- On finite orbits of infinite correspondences. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These problems, and the question how the semi-algorithms for their treatment can be turned into algorithms, are intimately connected to problems of dynamical systems of algebraic correspondences. This connection, and some of its ascpects, are discussed in these notes.   

- The orbit-sum method for higher order equations. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08175" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

The orbit-sum method is a method that has played an important role in the enumeration of lattice walks of walks with small steps. This paper generalizes it to walks with large steps.  

- The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00875" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

This generalization relies on a thorough understanding of the Newton-Puiseux algorithm. This paper discusses how to encode algebraic series and derive information about the convex hull of their support.

- Inhomogeneous Restricted Lattice Walks. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06725" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>
