- A proof of concept implementation of the multivariate version of the Newton-Puiseux algorithm. It accompanies the paper ''The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series''.

- An implementation of an algorithm that takes a basis of an ideal $I$ of $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and output all elements of $I \cap \left( \mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y] \right)$. It is based on the paper ''Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals''.

- A proof of concept implementation of a semi-algorithm that takes a polynomial $p(x,y)$ and outputs a description of its non-trivial rational multiples of the form $f(x) - g(y)$. The semi-algorithm is described in the paper "Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case".
