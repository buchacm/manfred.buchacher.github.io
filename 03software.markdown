- <a href="https://github.com/buchacm/newtonPuiseuxAlgorithm.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [newtonPuiseux.m]</a> An implementation of the (multivariate) Newton-Puiseux algorithm, which accompanies the paper _The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series._

- <a href="https://github.com/buchacm/nearSeparation.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [nearSeparate.m]</a> An implementation of a semi-algorithm that takes an (irreducible) polynomial $p(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ as input and outputs a description of all elements of $\mathbb{C}(x) + \mathbb{C}(y)$ whose numerator is a multiple of $p$. The semi-algorithm is described in the paper _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case._

- <a href="https://github.com/buchacm/separation.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [separate.m]</a> An implementation of an algorithm which takes a basis of an ideal $I\subseteq\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and returns a description of all elements of $I\cap\left(\mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right).$ It is based on the paper _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals._
