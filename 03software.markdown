- A proof of concept implementation of the multivariate Newton-Puiseux algorithm in Mathematica, which accompanies the paper _The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series_ <a href="https://github.com/buchacm/newtonPuiseuxAlgorithm.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [newtonPuiseux.m] </a>

- An implementation of an algorithm that takes a basis of an ideal $I\subseteq\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and outputs all elements of $I \cap \left( \mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right)$. It is based on the paper _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals._

- A proof of concept implementation of a semi-algorithm that takes an (irreducible) polynomial $p(x,y)\in\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and outputs a description of its non-trivial rational multiples of the form $f(x) - g(y)$. The semi-algorithm is described in the paper _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case._
