- x(1-t(x+x^{-1}) F(x;t) = x - tF(0;t) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21753" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

This paper is an introduction to the enumeration of restricted lattice walks that can also be seen as an introduction to my research.

- Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3373207.3404028" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>\

 Proceedings of the 45th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, 54 - 61, 2020 

- Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10377" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

- Separated variables on plane algebraic curves <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08584" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These articles discuss problems of finding polynomials / rational functions whose variables are separated. The first explains how to determine $I \cap \left(\mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right)$ when $I$ is an ideal in a bivariate polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ given in terms of a bases. The second and third continue the ideas developed therein to study equations of the form $r(x,y) + q(x,y) p(x,y) = f(x) - g(y)$ for rational functions $r$, $q$, $p$ and $f$ and $g$ of which only the rational function $r$ and the polynnomial $p$ is known. The latter has field theoretic interpretations.

- On finite orbits of infinite correspondences <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These problems, and the question how the semi-algorithms for their treatment can be turned into algorithms, are intimately connected to problems in algebraic dynamics. This connection, and some of its ascpects, are discussed in these notes.   

- The orbit-sum method for higher order equations <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08175" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

The orbit-sum method is a method that has played an important role in the enumeration of lattice walks of walks with small steps. This paper generalizes it to walks with large steps.  

- The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869325005642" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>\
  Journal of Algebra, 688, 284-306, 2026

This generalization relies on a thorough understanding of the Newton-Puiseux algorithm. This paper discusses, among other things, how it can be used to encode algebraic series and derive information about the convex hull of their support.

- Inhomogeneous Restricted Lattice Walks <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/FPSAC2019/75.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>\

  Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire, 82B, Art. 75, 12pp, 2019.

This article introduces a class of lattice walks that leads to the study of systems of so-called discrete differential equations. We show that solutions of systems of linear ordinary discrete differential equations are algebraic and explain how their minimal polynomial can be found.
