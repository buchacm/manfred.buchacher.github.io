__Elimination theory__

- _The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series,_ Journal of Algebra, 688, 284-306, 2026 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869325005642" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>

- _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals,_ with Manuel Kauers and Gleb Pogudin, Proceedings of the 45th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, 54 - 61, 2020 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3373207.3404028" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>

- _Separating variables in bivariate polynomial ideals: the local case,_ 2024 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10377" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

- _Separated variables on plane algebraic curves, 2024_ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08584" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These three articles are dedicated to several non-standard elimination problems. The first explains how to determine $I \cap \left(\mathbb{C}[x] + \mathbb{C}[y]\right)$ when $I$ is an ideal in a bivariate polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$ given in terms of a bases. The second and third continue the ideas developed therein to study equations of the form $r(x,y) + q(x,y) p(x,y) = f(x) - g(y)$ for rational functions $r$, $q$, $p$ and $f$ and $g$ of which only the rational function $r$ and the polynnomial $p$ is known. The latter has field theoretic interpretations.

- _On finite orbits of infinite correspondences, 2025_ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

These problems, and the question how the corresponding semi-algorithms can be turned into algorithms, are intimately connected to problems in algebraic dynamics. This connection, and some of its ascpects, are discussed in these notes.

- _On the problem of separating variables in multivariate polynomial ideals,_ with Manuel Kauers, Proceedings of the 49th International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, 100 - 107, 2024 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3666000.3669680" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>


__Dynamical systems__ 

- _On finite orbits of infinite correspondences,_ 2025 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>
  

__Enumeration of lattice walks__

- _x(1-t(x+x^{-1}) F(x;t) = x - tF(0;t),_ 2025 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21753" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

This paper is an introduction to the enumeration of restricted lattice walks that can also be seen as an introduction to my research.

- _The orbit-sum method for higher order equations,_ with Manuel Kauers, 2022 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08175" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [arXiv] </a>

The orbit-sum method is a method that has played an important role in the enumeration of lattice walks of walks with small steps. This paper generalizes it to walks with large steps.  

- _The Newton-Puiseux algorithm and effective algebraic series,_ Journal of Algebra, 688, 284-306, 2026 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021869325005642" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>

This generalization relies on a thorough understanding of the Newton-Puiseux algorithm. This paper discusses, among other things, how it can be used to encode algebraic series and derive information about the convex hull of their support.
  
- _Inhomogeneous restricted lattice walks,_ with Manuel Kauers, Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire, 82B, Art. 75, 12pp, 2019 <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/FPSAC2019/75.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>

This article introduces a class of lattice walks that leads to the study of systems of so-called discrete differential equations. We show that solutions of systems of linear ordinary discrete differential equations are algebraic and explain how their minimal polynomial can be found. 

- _Quadrant walks starting outside the quadrant,_ with Manuel Kauers and Amélie Trotignon, Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire, 75B, Art. 26, 11pp, 2021 <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~slc/wpapers/FPSAC2021/26Buchacher.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>

- _Walks with small steps in the 4D-orthant,_ with Sophie Hofmanninger and Manuel Kauers, Annals of Combinatorics, 25, 153–166, 2021 <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00026-020-00520-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> [link] </a>
