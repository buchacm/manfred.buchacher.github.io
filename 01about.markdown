I'm a mathematician who works on problems that arise in __algorithmic enumerative combinatorics.__ My research interests range from __enumerative combinatorics__, __constructive algebra__ and __effective algebraic geometry__ to __differential algebra__ and __dynamical systems__ of algebraic correspondences. 

The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the __enumeration of lattice walks__ restricted to convex cones. It can be approached by considering the associated generating function and solving the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and to determine such an equation. There are different ways this can be done. My work follows an algebraic approach which considers generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and restricts to methods that rely on elementary power series algebra only. These methods give rise to basic problems in __effective algebraic geometry__ and __differential algebra.__ My research is dedicated to the study of these problems and aims to provide a toolbox for their algorithmic treatment. Check out the section on publications and the comments therein for more information. 

This web page provides a __research statement__, published and not yet published __articles__, __software__, __slides__ of selected presentations and a __CV__ with information on talks, conferences, research visits and teaching.
