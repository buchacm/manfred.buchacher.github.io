I'm a mathematician who works on problems that arise in __algorithmic enumerative combinatorics__. My research interests range from __enumerative combinatorics__, __constructive algebra__ and __effective algebraic geometry__ to __differential algebra__ and __dynamical systems.__

The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the __enumeration of lattice walks__ restricted to convex cones. It can be approached by considering the associated generating function and solving the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and to determine such an equation. There are different ways this can be done. My work follows an algebraic approach which considers generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and restricts to methods that rely on elementary power series algebra only. These methods give rise to basic algebraic problems that are interesting in their own. These are problems in __constructive algebra__ that are important in __effective algebraic geometry__ and __differential algebra__. Their solutions have applications not only in the enumeration of lattice walks but also in parameter identification in ode models, computer vision and design of optical systems, for instance. My research is dedicated to the study of these algebraic problems and aims to provide a toolbox for their algorithmic treatment. The section on publications and the comments therein provide more information. 

Still under construction, this webpage is planned to provide a __research statement__, published and not yet published __articles__, __software__, __slides__ of selected presentations and a CV with information on talks, conferences, research visits and teaching.
