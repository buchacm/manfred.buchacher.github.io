I'm a mathematician who works on problems that arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My research interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra and effective algebraic geometry to differential algebra and dynamical systems.

Still under construction, this webpage is planned to provide a research statement, published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, information on talks, conferences, research visits, teaching, and a short CV.
