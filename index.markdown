I am a mathematician who works at the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Johannes Kepler University Linz </a> as a postdoctorial researcher. I am currently sponsored by the <a href="https://www.jku.at/en/linz-institute-of-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Linz Institute of Technology </a> and the State of Upper Austria with the LIT Young Career Award LIT-2022-11-YOU-214.    

I work on problems that arise in __algorithmic enumerative combinatorics__. I connect __enumerative combinatorics__ to __constructive algebra__, __effective algebraic geometry__, __differential algebra__ and __dynamical systems__ of algebraic correspondences.
