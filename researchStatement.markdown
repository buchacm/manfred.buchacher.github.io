The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the enumeration of lattice walks restricted to convex cones. It can be approached by considering the associated generating function and solving the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and to determine such an equation. There are different ways this can be done. My work follows an algebraic approach which considers generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and restricts to methods that rely on elementary power series algebra only. These methods give rise to basic algebraic problems that are interesting in their own. They arise in many other contexts, and their solutions have not only in the enumeration of lattice walks but also parameter identification in ode models, computer vision and design of optical systems, for instance. My research is dedicated to the study of these algebraic problems and to provide a toolbox that allows one to solve them in algorithmic way.
