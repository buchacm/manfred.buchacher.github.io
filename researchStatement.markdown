The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the enumeration of lattice walks restricted to convex cones. The problem can be approached by considering the associated generating function and solving the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and determine such an equation. There are different ways to find such equations. My work follows an algebraic approach which considers generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and restricts to elementary power series algebra.          

The methods based thereon give rise to basic algebraic problems that are interesting themselves and also arise in other contexts and have applications in parameter identification in ode models, computer vision and design of optical systems.
