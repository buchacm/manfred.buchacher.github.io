The starting point of my research is an enumeration problem: the enumeration of lattice walks restricted to convex cones. The problem can be approached by considering the associated generating function and studying the functional equation it satisfies. To solve the equation means to decide whether its solution satisfies an algebraic or differential equation and to determine such an equation. There are different ways to find such equations. My work follows an algebraic one that consideres generating functions not as analytic but formal objects and is restricted to elementary power series algebra.
