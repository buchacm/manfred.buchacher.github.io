I am a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra, differential algebra, effective algebraic geometry to dynamical systems.    

On this webpage you can find my published as well as not yet published articles, software, and slides of selected presentations. You can find a research statement.
