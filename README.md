I am a mathematician who works on problems which arise in algorithmic enumerative combinatorics. My interests range from enumerative combinatorics, constructive algebra, differential algebra, effective algebraic geometry to dynamical systems.    

On this webpage you can find my published and not yet published articles, software, slides of selected presentations, a research statement, information on teaching, talks, conferences, research visits, and a short CV.
